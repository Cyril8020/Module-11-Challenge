In this module challenge we had to scrape a website about Mars and its weather and analyze things such as Average Daily temperature per month and Average Pressure.
This challenge's analysis is focused on find which months are the hottest and coldest as well as which months have the highest and lowest pressure. In the end we were
asked to estimate how many terrestrial days were in a Martian year.
